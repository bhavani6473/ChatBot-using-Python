**Chatbot Development â€“ Python & NLTK**

I successfully developed a simple chatbot from scratch using Python and the NLTK library. This project was an introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and allowed me to apply foundational concepts in a practical setting.

**Project Overview: Chatbot Implementation**
The chatbot was designed to engage in basic conversations, utilizing NLTK for text processing. Although it possesses minimal cognitive abilities, this project served as an excellent entry point into the world of NLP. The goal was to leverage my newly acquired Python skills to create a functional bot, exploring the basics of language processing.

**Technologies Used**

**Python**: Core programming language for building the chatbot.
**NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: Library used for text processing and language understanding.
The project involved setting up the environment, handling user inputs, and generating appropriate responses, all within a structured and modular codebase. This experience significantly enhanced my understanding of NLP and Python, paving the way for more advanced projects in the future.
